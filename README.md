# AI Assistant Chatbot

## Overview

The **AI Assistant Chatbot** leverages a custom-trained conversational model to interact naturally with users and provide intelligent responses. It is designed to fetch live data, process natural language input, and respond contextually to a wide variety of queries. This repository provides everything you need to deploy and use the chatbot, including detailed documentation, usage examples, and setup instructions.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Powered by an advanced language model, capable of handling diverse queries and generating meaningful responses.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend or modify the behavior and functionality of the assistant by updating the underlying model and response generation logic.
- **Live Data Fetching**: Integrates with live data sources to enrich the responses.
- **Easy Deployment**: Dockerized for easy deployment and scalability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-assistant-chatbot.git
cd ai-assistant-chatbot
```

Install Dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. To set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Setup the Environment
If you plan to run the chatbot locally, make sure you have access to the necessary API keys or other configurations required by the model or external data sources. Refer to config.py for environment-specific settings.

# Usage
Running the Chatbot
To interact with the chatbot, simply run the following command:
```bash
python src/chatbot/chat_with_model.py
```

The chatbot will start and prompt you to enter text. Type your message, and the assistant will generate a response based on the model's trained knowledge.

Example Interaction:
```bash
$ python src/chatbot/chat_with_model.py
> Hello, assistant!
Assistant: Hello! How can I assist you today?
> What's the weather like in New York?
Assistant: The weather in New York is 25Â°C with clear skies.
```

# Dockerized Deployment (Optional)
To deploy the chatbot in a containerized environment, you can use Docker. The repository includes a Dockerfile that contains the necessary configuration to build and run the application.

Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t ai-assistant-chatbot .
```

Run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 ai-assistant-chatbot
```

This will start the chatbot application inside a Docker container, and you can access it locally at http://localhost:5000.

# Documentation
Architecture
The chatbot is designed using the following architecture:
